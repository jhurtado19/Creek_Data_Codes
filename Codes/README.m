% Script list %
% makeplot.m creates normal distribution of peak times 
% makeplottroughs creates normal distribution trough times
% makemixedplot.m creates plot of WQL peaks and temp trough
% WQLtTpm creates plot of WQL troughs and temp peak
% plotfullnormspec plots all the normal distributions of all parameters

% Functions list % 
% Normalpeaks finds and plots the normal distribution of peaks 
% Normalpeaks2 finds and plots the normal distribution of peaks but eliminates the
% first peak in a signal
% Normealfreaks finds plots the normal distribution of the troughs and
% plots them below the x-axis
% Normealfreaks2 is the same as in nf1 but eliminates the first trough. 
% Plotpeaks plots signal with its peaks and troughs
% fullspec plots normal distributions of peaks and troughs as one signal
% fullspec2 the sameasfs1 but omits first peak and trough
